In ip_address.py, I implemented a quadruple nested for loop, and I output the ip addresses as 4 numbers separated by dashes.

In reverselist.py, I implemented a list, and used the reverse method for the list class to print the list in reverse order.

In word_count.py, I used a file, list, dictionary, and orderedlist object (the latter from the collections library) to organize the input_file.

I spent around 30 minutes on this lab
