The Laser.py module contains the laser class.

The Battlecruiser.py module contains the battlecruiser class and the game loop

Two lasers fire from the guns of the ship and make a laser sound upon being shot.

Motion is continued as long as the key is held down, however if you hold down 'up' (or left), then hold down 'down' (or 'right'), then let go of either of them, the ship stops moving in that direction.

The speed of the ship, speed of the lasers, screen dimensions, and FPS are all constants
